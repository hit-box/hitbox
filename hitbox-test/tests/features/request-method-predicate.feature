Feature: Request Method Predicate Functionality

  Background:
    Given hitbox with policy
      ```yaml
      Enabled:
        ttl: 10
      ```

  @integration
  Scenario: Method Eq operation - match method request
    Given request predicates
      ```yaml
      - Method: GET
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @integration
  Scenario: Method Eq operation - non-matching method returns non-cacheable
    Given request predicates
      ```yaml
      - Method: POST
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 0 records

  @integration
  Scenario: Method In operation - method in allowed list cached
    Given request predicates
      ```yaml
      - Method:
          - GET
          - HEAD
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 1 records
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "HIT"

  @integration
  Scenario: Method In operation - empty list behavior
    Given request predicates
      ```yaml
      - Method: []
      ```
    When execute request
      ```hurl
      GET http://localhost/v1/authors/robert-sheckley/books/victim-prime
      ```
    Then response status is 200
    And response header "X-Cache-Status" is "MISS"
    And cache has 0 records
